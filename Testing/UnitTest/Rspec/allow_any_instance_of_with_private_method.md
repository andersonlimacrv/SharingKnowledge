### allow_any_instance_of can stub private method

~~~html
The reason allow_any_instance_of can stub private methods is because it allows you to stub or mock any instance of a class, regardless of the visibility of the method. This means that you can use allow_any_instance_of to stub private methods without modifying the class or its visibility.

Here's an example of how you can use allow_any_instance_of to stub a private method:
~~~

~~~ruby
allow_any_instance_of(MyClass).to receive(:private_method) do
  # do something
end
~~~

~~~html
It's worth noting that using allow_any_instance_of is considered a bad practice by some, as it can lead to brittle tests and make the code harder to refactor. It violates the principles of encapsulation and can make the test tightly coupled to the implementation details of the class. Therefore, it's recommended to consider other alternatives such as testing through the public interface or extracting the code into a separate class, if possible.

### can we use allow to stub private method?

~~~html
No, you cannot use allow alone to stub a private method in RSpec. The allow method is primarily used to stub or mock public methods of an object or class.

The allow method is typically used in conjunction with the receive method to define the behavior of a method. For example:
~~~

~~~ruby
allow(object).to receive(:public_method).and_return("stubbed value")
~~~

~~~html
However, when it comes to private methods, allow alone will not work because private methods are not directly accessible from outside the class.
~~~

### there are other ways to stub private methods in Ruby.

~~~ruby
it "tests the private method directly" do
 	expect(MyClass.send(:my_private_method)).to eq("private method")
end
~~~
