- There are mainly four Levels of Testing in software testing :

1. Unit Testing: checks if software components are fulfilling functionalities or not.
2. Integration Testing: checks the data flow from one module to other modules.
3. System Testing: evaluates both functional and non-functional needs for the testing.
4. Acceptance Testing: checks the requirements of a specification or contract are met as per its delivery.
