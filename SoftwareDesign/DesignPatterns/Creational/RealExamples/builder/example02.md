### example

```html
Suppose we have a class called Car that represents a car. The Car class has several attributes, including a make, model, color, engine type, and transmission type. We want to create cars with different combinations of these attributes. To accomplish this, we can use the Builder pattern.

First, we create a builder class called CarBuilder that is responsible for building cars:
```

```ruby
class CarBuilder
  def initialize
    @car = Car.new
  end

  def with_make(make)
    @car.make = make
    self
  end

  def with_model(model)
    @car.model = model
    self
  end

  def with_color(color)
    @car.color = color
    self
  end

  def with_engine_type(engine_type)
    @car.engine_type = engine_type
    self
  end

  def with_transmission_type(transmission_type)
    @car.transmission_type = transmission_type
    self
  end

  def build
    @car
  end
end
```

```html
The CarBuilder class has an initializer method that creates a new, empty Car object. It also has several methods that allow us to set the attributes of the car, including with_make, with_model, with_color, with_engine_type, and with_transmission_type. Finally, it has a build method that returns the completed Car object.

Next, we define the Car class itself:
```

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :model, :color, :engine_type, :transmission_type

  def initialize
    @make = nil
    @model = nil
    @color = nil
    @engine_type = nil
    @transmission_type = nil
  end
end
```

```html
The Car class has an initializer method that creates a new, empty Car object with default attribute values of nil. It also has attributes for the car's make, model, color, engine type, and transmission type.

Now, let's say we want to create a new car with a make of "Toyota", model of "Camry", color of "silver", engine type of "V6", and transmission type of "automatic". We can use the CarBuilder class as follows:
```

```ruby
car = CarBuilder.new
                .with_make("Toyota")
                .with_model("Camry")
                .with_color("silver")
                .with_engine_type("V6")
                .with_transmission_type("automatic")
                .build
```

```html
This creates a new CarBuilder object, sets the desired attribute values, and builds a new Car object with the specified attributes.

Using the Builder pattern in this way allows us to create cars with different combinations of attributes without having to create separate constructors or initializer methods for each combination. It also allows us to add or remove attributes as desired, making the creation process more flexible.
```
