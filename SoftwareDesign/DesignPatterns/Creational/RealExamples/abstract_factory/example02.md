- In this example, we define an abstract PizzaFactory class that has two abstract methods, create_cheese_pizza and create_pepperoni_pizza. We then define two concrete factory classes, NYCPizzaFactory and ChicagoPizzaFactory, that implement these methods to create different types of pizzas for each type of restaurant.

- We also define abstract CheesePizza and PepperoniPizza classes that define the prepare method, and concrete NYCCheesePizza, NYCPepperoniPizza, ChicagoCheesePizza, and ChicagoPepperoniPizza classes that implement these classes for each type of restaurant.

- Finally, we create a factory instance for a NYC-style restaurant and use it to create a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza for that restaurant, which we then call the prepare method on.

- This example demonstrates how the Abstract Factory pattern can be used to create families of related objects for different contexts, such as different types of restaurants in this case. The main difference between the Abstract Factory and Factory Method patterns is that the Abstract Factory creates families of related objects, while the Factory Method creates individual objects.
