### example

```html
Suppose you have an application that needs to interact with an external API that requires authentication. You might create a Client class to handle the API requests, but you only want to authenticate once and reuse the authentication token for subsequent requests. Here's how you can use the Singleton pattern to solve this problem:
```

```ruby
require 'singleton'
require 'httparty'

class Client
  include Singleton

  API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com'

  def initialize
    @auth_token = authenticate
  end

  def get(path)
    HTTParty.get("#{API_BASE_URL}/#{path}", headers: headers)
  end

  def post(path, data)
    HTTParty.post("#{API_BASE_URL}/#{path}", headers: headers, body: data.to_json)
  end

  private

  def authenticate
    response = HTTParty.post("#{API_BASE_URL}/auth", body: {username: 'user', password: 'password'}.to_json)
    response['auth_token']
  end

  def headers
    {'Authorization' => "Bearer #{@auth_token}", 'Content-Type' => 'application/json'}
  end
end
```

```html
In this example, we're using the Singleton module to ensure that there is only one instance of the Client class. When the instance is created, it automatically authenticates with the API and stores the authentication token in an instance variable.

The get and post methods are used to make API requests, and they automatically include the authentication token in the headers. The authenticate method is private and is called only once when the instance is created.

By using the Singleton pattern, we ensure that there is only one instance of the Client class, and that the authentication token is reused for subsequent API requests. This can help to reduce the number of authentication requests made to the API, which can be especially important when dealing with rate limits.
