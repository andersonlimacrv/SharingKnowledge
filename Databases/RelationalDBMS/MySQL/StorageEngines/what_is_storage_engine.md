```ruby
    MySql generally has three layers:

    Top layer : connection handling, authentication, security
    Middle layer: query parsing, analysis, optimization, caching and
            built-in functions
    Botton layer: storage engines

    A storage engine is a software module that a database
    management system uses to create, read, update data from
    a database like for example MySQL Innodb and MyIsam.
