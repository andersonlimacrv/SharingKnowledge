```sql

-> result from group by
```html
marksum  firstname
----------------
94      ann
134     arun
47      new
41      sruthy
```

```sql
SELECT SUM(Mark) OVER (PARTITION BY id) AS marksum, firstname FROM TableA
```
-> result from partition

```html
marksum firstname
-------------------
134     arun
134     arun
134     arun
94      ann
94      ann
41      sruthy
47      new
```

### PARTITION BY is analytic, while GROUP BY is aggregate
