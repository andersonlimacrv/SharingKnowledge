### SQL INTERSECT and MINUS are useful clauses for quickly finding
the difference between two tables and finding the rows they share.

1. INTERSECT
- compares the data between tables and returns only the rows of data that exist in both tables.

2. MINUS
- compares the data between tables and returns the rows of data that exist only in the first table you specify.
