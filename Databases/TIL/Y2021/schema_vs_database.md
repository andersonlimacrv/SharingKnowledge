### definition

```html
Schema is a structural definition or description of an entire database.
Once you declare the schema of a database, it should not be changed frequently
as it will disturb the organisation of data in a database.
```

```html
The database is a collection of well-organised and interrelated data.
The database includes structure (Schema), data types and constraints of the data to be stored and the data i.e. facts or information about an object in consideration.
