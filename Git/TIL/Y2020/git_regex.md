To delete many branches based on a specified pattern do the following:

1. Open the terminal, or equivalent.
2. Type in
`git branch | grep "<pattern>" for a preview of the branches that will be deleted.`
3. Type in
`git branch | grep "<pattern>" | xargs git branch -D`

Replace the <pattern> with a regular expression to match your branch names and that’s it.
```

```ruby
grep: Global Regular Expression
```
