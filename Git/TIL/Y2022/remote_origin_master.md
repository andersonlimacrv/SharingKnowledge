### remote
	is just some git repository not on your computer (e.g. on github).

### origin
	is the repository you cloned your repository from (e.g. the one on your github).

### master
 	is just the name of the default branch. It's called "master" because generally it's the branch that represents production code, and that all other branches come from and generally eventually rejoin.
