### there are 3 main important factors in a system

1. Performance
  + Load Balancer
  + CDN
  + Caching

2. Availability ( measure by uptime unit )
  + Master/Slave
  + Replication

3. Scalbility
  + Vertical Scaling
  + Horizontal Scaling
  + Application Server ( code should be stateless )
  + Database Server
    - read more / write less
      a. design master/slave
        + master for read/write
        + many slaves for reading
    - read and write equally
      b. sharding database

### notes
- Vertical scaling refers to adding more resources (CPU/RAM/DISK) to your server
(database or application server is still remains one) as on demand
- Horizontal Scaling is a must use technology â€“ whenever a high availability of (server) services are required
