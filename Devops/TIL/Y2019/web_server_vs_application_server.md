  1. web server
    - a web server is a program that uses HTTP to serves
    the static files to users, in response to their requests.
    - but what if happens if a web server gets a request that
    has to be processed dynamically?
    That's when an application servers come in

  2. application server
    - it is a server program in a computer in a distributed
    network that provides the business logic for an application
    program
