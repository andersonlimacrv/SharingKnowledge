### access token
~~~html
An access token is a string of characters that represents a user's permission to access a specific resource or set of resources. It is typically generated by an authentication server and sent to the client, which then sends the token to the resource server when making a request for a protected resource. The resource server uses the token to determine whether the client is authorized to access the requested resource.

Access tokens can come from a variety of different authentication methods, such as:

1. HTTP Basic Authentication: In this method, a client sends a user's credentials (typically a username and password) to the server in an HTTP request header. The server then checks the credentials against a database of users and generates an access token if the credentials are valid.

2. HTTP Digest Authentication: Similar to basic authentication, but the password is hashed before it is sent to the server to increase security.

3. Session-based Auth: This method involves the server creating a session for the user when they log in, and then sending a session ID to the client. The client then sends the session ID back to the server with each subsequent request for a protected resource, and the server uses the session ID to look up the user's session and check that they are logged in.

4. Token-Based Authentication: In token-based authentication, the client sends a request to the server for authentication, and the server sends back a token that the client can use to authenticate subsequent requests. Tokens are usually short lived and expires after certain amount of time.

5. One Time Passwords: In this method, the user is given a one-time password to use in place of a permanent password. This password can be generated by an application or sent to the user via SMS or email.

6. OAuth and OpenID: OAuth and OpenID are used to grant third-party applications access to a user's resources or to authenticate a user to an application, respectively. In both cases, the server generates an access token that the client uses to access the protected resource or authenticate the user.

In all cases the token is short lived and should be refreshed after certain period of time.
