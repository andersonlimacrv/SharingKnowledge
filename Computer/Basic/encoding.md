Encoding:

1. Purpose: The purpose of encoding is to transform data so that it can be properly (and safely) consumed by a different type of system.
2. Used for: Maintaining data usability i.e., to ensure that it is able to be properly consumed.
3. Data Retrieval Mechanism: No key and can be easily reversed provided we know what algorithm was used in encoding.
4. Algorithms Used: ASCII, Unicode, URL Encoding, Base64.
5. Example: Binary data being sent over email, or viewing special characters on a web page.
