### for case with server response a large number of fields
~~~html
To improve the performance of the given gRPC code, here are a few suggestions:

1. Reduce the size of the response:
The MemberDetails message has a large number of fields, some of which might not be needed in all cases. Consider only returning the necessary fields to reduce the size of the response and improve the performance.

2. Use server-side streaming:
If the response is still large even after reducing the number of fields, consider using server-side streaming. Instead of returning all the member details in a single response, you can send the details in small chunks using a stream. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data sent over the network at once.

3. Cache frequently accessed data:
If some of the data, like member or user details, is frequently accessed, consider caching the data to reduce database queries and improve performance.

4. Use a database query optimizer:
The current implementation of the call method retrieves the member from the database using the member ID. If the database has a large number of members, this query can become slow. Consider using a database query optimizer like an index or a cache to speed up the query.

5. Use asynchronous gRPC calls:
If the gRPC calls are made sequentially, they can cause a delay in the response. Consider using asynchronous gRPC calls to improve performance by allowing multiple calls to be made in parallel.

6. Use protocol buffers compression:
Protocol Buffers supports compression to reduce the size of messages being transmitted over the network. Consider using compression to improve performance by reducing the amount of data sent over the network.
