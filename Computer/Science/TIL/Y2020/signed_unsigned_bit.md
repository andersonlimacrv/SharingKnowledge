    - The 'signed' indicator means that the item can hold positive/negative values.
    - The 'unsigned' doesn't distinguish between positive/negative values.
    - A signed/unsigned variable can refer to any numerical data type (such as:
    binary, integer, float, etc...)

    - 8-bit signed value can hold value from 0-127 (1 bit is used for the sign and 7 bits for
    the value), while an 8-bit unsigned binary could hold values from 0-255
