```html
  <script>
    - used to define a client side script
  <script async>
    - the script is executed asynchronously with
    the rest of page (the script is executed while the page
    continue parsing)
  <script defer>
    - tells the browser to only execute the script
    file once the HTML document has been fully parsed
```
