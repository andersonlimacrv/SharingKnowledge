    Yarn Workspaces manages our dependencies. Rather than having multiple node_modules directories, it intelligently optimizes the installing of dependencies together and
    allows for the cross-linking of dependencies in a monorepo.
    Yarn Workspaces provide tools, like Lerna, the low-level primitives it needs
    to manage multi-package repositories.
