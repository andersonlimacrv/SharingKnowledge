Do nhiều người vẫn đang stuck với câu hỏi là "nên đi hay ở lại?", mình có làm 1 cái framework nho nhỏ để giúp mọi người đánh giá tình huống 1 cách rõ ràng hơn. Hy vọng framework sẽ giúp mọi người có thêm nhiều góc nhìn cũng như là nhìn thấy rõ hơn những gì cần thấy mà chúng ta không thấy được do đầu óc đang rối bời và không nghĩ được gì :)

1 trang trong framework:

### Leave the Company:
If your total score falls below 16, it indicates a low level of job satisfaction and may be a signal that it's time to consider leaving the company. A low score suggests that multiple aspects of your job are unsatisfactory, and staying may hinder your growth and overall happiness.

### Stay with the Company:
If your total score falls within the range of 17-32, it suggests a moderate to high level of job satisfaction, providing reasons to consider staying with the company. However, it's important to evaluate the individual scores for each criterion to ensure there are no significant areas of dissatisfaction that may impact your long-term happiness.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The company you're joining better be an upgrade (eg. higher score) or you'll be trading one set of problems for another. After all, if you're leaving your current company for something worse, you might as well stay and enjoy the devil you know!
