### a 4-step process for effective system design interview
1. Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope
~~~html
- Slow down. Think deeply and ask questions to clarify requirements and assumptions.
This is extremely important.

- What kind of questions to ask? Ask questions to understand the exact requirements.
Here is a list of questions to help you get started:
	+ What specific features are we going to build?
	+ How many users does the product have?
	+ How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and a year?
	+ What is the companyâ€™s technology stack? What existing services you might leverage to simplify the design?

2. Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in

- Come up with an initial blueprint for the design. Ask for feedback.
Treat your interviewer as a teammate and work together.
Many good interviewers love to talk and get involved.

- Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper.
This might include clients (mobile/web), APIs, web servers,
data stores, cache, CDN, message queue, etc.

- Do back-of-the-envelope calculations to evaluate if your blueprint
fits the scale constraints. Think out loud. Communicate with your
interviewer if back-of-the-envelope is necessary before diving into it.
