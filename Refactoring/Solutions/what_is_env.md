@env in Sinatra is a reference to the Rack environment hash that contains information about the current HTTP request and response.

Rack is a Ruby web framework that provides a standard interface between web servers and Ruby web applications. Sinatra is built on top of Rack and provides a lightweight web framework for creating Ruby web applications.

When a request is received by Sinatra, it passes the request to Rack to process. Rack then creates an environment hash that contains information about the request and response, such as headers, cookies, and request parameters. This environment hash is passed to the Sinatra application as the env parameter.

Within a Sinatra route or method, you can access the @env instance variable to retrieve information about the current request and response. For example, you can access @env['REQUEST_METHOD'] to retrieve the HTTP method of the current request or @env['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] to retrieve the user agent of the client making the request.

Overall, the @env instance variable in Sinatra comes from Rack and provides a way to access information about the current HTTP request and response in your Sinatra application.
