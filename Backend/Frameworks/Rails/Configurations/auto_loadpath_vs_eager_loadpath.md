config.autoload_paths and config.eager_load_paths are configuration options in Ruby on Rails that are used to define the paths where the application should look for classes and modules to load.

The key difference between these two configuration options is the timing of when the classes and modules are loaded.

config.autoload_paths: This configuration option specifies the directories that Rails should search for classes and modules as they are needed. This means that the classes and modules are loaded on demand when they are first used by the application.

config.eager_load_paths: This configuration option specifies the directories that Rails should search for classes and modules when the application starts up. This means that all classes and modules in the specified directories are loaded into memory immediately, regardless of whether or not they are actually used by the application.

In other words, config.autoload_paths is used for lazy-loading of classes and modules, while config.eager_load_paths is used for eager-loading of classes and modules. Eager-loading can be faster for large applications because it loads all the classes and modules at once, reducing the number of filesystem operations needed to load classes and modules on demand. However, it can also increase the startup time of the application.

~~~html
config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join("lib")
config.eager_load_paths << Rails.root.join("lib")

This configuration is not necessarily redundant, depending on your specific use case.

The config.autoload_paths configuration tells Rails to load Ruby files located in the specified directories automatically. In this case, it is telling Rails to automatically load files located in the lib directory. This is useful if you have custom code or modules located in the lib directory that you want to use in your Rails application.

The config.eager_load_paths configuration tells Rails which directories should be eager loaded in production mode. Eager loading means that the code is loaded at startup rather than lazily when it is actually needed. In this case, it is telling Rails to eagerly load files located in the lib directory. This is useful if you have custom code or modules that are required for your application to function correctly and you want to ensure that they are loaded as early as possible.

So, depending on your specific use case, these configurations could be very useful and not redundant at all. However, if you do not have any custom code or modules in the lib directory, then these configurations would be unnecessary and could be removed.
