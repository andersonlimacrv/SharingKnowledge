- Nix is a cross-platform package manager that uses a purely functional deployment model, installing software into unique directories generated through cryptographic hashes.
It also refers to the custom programming language used for package management.
Nix ensures reproducible builds and eliminates dependency hell by taking into account the dependencies in the package's hash. This allows for more reliable, reproducible, and portable packages. Nix supports Linux and macOS and can be installed alongside existing package managers.

- NixOS, a Linux distribution, uses Nix as both a package manager and a configuration manager. It allows for atomic updates and efficient roll-backs, ensuring the system's stability. Nixpkgs is a large collection of package descriptions in the Nix language, making it easy to build applications targeting multiple platforms and languages.
