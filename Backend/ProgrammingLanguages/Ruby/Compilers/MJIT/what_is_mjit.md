[MJIT](https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-mjit): A Method Based Just-in-time Compiler for Ruby

### How does a Ruby program run?
- Computers don’t speak Ruby or any other high-level language, they only speak machine language

- In a compiled language like C++ you use a compiler to convert all of your C++ code into machine language directly before you run your program.

- When you’re using an interpreted language like Ruby, your code is compiled into some other intermediary language, which is then run by the language virtual machine (VM).
