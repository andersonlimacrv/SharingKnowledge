```html
  - a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets [],
  seperated by commas
  - it can have any number of items and they maybe of different type (integer, float, string, etc...)

  - example:
    my_list = []
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]
    my_list = ["mouse", [8, 4, 6], ['a']]
```

```html
  - noted
    colon ':'' is the delimiter of the slice syntax to 'slice out' sub-parts in sequences,[start:end]
  - examples
    >>> a=[1,2,3,4,5]
    >>> a[1:3]
    [2, 3]
    >>> a[:3]
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> a[2:]
    [3, 4, 5]
    >>> s='computer'
    >>> s[:3]
    'com'
    >>> s[3:6]
    'put'
```
