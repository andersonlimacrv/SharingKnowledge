  Hi, somewhere in the earth

  At the moment it seems that we have cleared a major risk for preparation
  for nationwide *** launch.

  ***  and the team  did outstanding job to  finish  the feature development of ***
  and even  fixed the major bugs  during  the weekend. This  was done  according to
  our estimated schedule  and without show  stoppers.
  I  wish  also  the management  of  [company name]  to  know, that  this
  was not a walk  in  the park. This  required  enormous  stretch from  team
  in  [country name],  as  there was a developer resigning during  this  period,
  and still team  managed to  make  all ready on  time. Also  during  that
  time  we  made  substantial progress  with  another product;  ***, and now we
  are able  to  proceed with  this  and new landing page  feature with  less  stress.
  The  launch  shall happen  starting  with  his Excellency  on  [Date]
  and there will  be  continuous  marketing efforts in  all channels  news, tv,
  social  media and partner channels    for next  [future time].
  *** will  try to  reach over  [amount of number] non-registered
  users in  our databases and in  *** databases.  This  brings  in  lots
  of  pressure  to  our platform, but we  have  also  prepared  for it. *** has been
  leading the platform  team  to  make  changes for us  to  be  able  to
  sustain such  demand. We are now in  good  shape,  but there is  still work
  to  do. With  best  reg
