>> If the interviewer says: “Tell me about a time when you had to be very strategic in order to meet all of your top priorities.”

>> Your response might be (just, you know, don’t actually say “situation” and so forth):

1. Situation: “In my previous sales role, I was put in charge of the transition to an entirely new customer relationship management (CRM) system—on top of handling my daily sales calls and responsibilities.”

2. Task: “The goal was to have the migration to the new CRM database completed by the start of Q3, without letting any of my own sales numbers slip below my targets.”

3. Action: “In order to do that, I had to be very careful about how I managed my time. So I blocked off an hour on my calendar each day to dedicate solely to the CRM migration. During that time, I worked on transferring the data, as well as cleaning out old contacts and fixing outdated information. Doing this gave me enough time to chip away at that project while still handling my normal tasks.”

4. Result: “As a result, the transfer was completed two weeks ahead of deadline and I finished the quarter 10% ahead of my sales goal. The new CRM has also helped us get more organized as a team, and overall our department sales are up 25% year over year.”
