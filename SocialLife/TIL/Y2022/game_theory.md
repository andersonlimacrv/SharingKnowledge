### Martingale

1. A player loses betting 1 TRX to roll over 50
2. The player bets a 2 TRX to roll over 50
3. If that bet loses, the player bets 4 TRX to roll over 50
4. This pattern continues until the player correctly predicts a roll.
  In this case, when finally you win it will recover all previous losses plus the 1TRX profit.

### The Labouchère system (split martingale)

1. A player wants to win 2000TRX
2. He divides this amount into 5 parts: 400, 400, 400, 400, 400
3. Take into account that the betting coefficient must be at least x2.
4. His first bet must be the sum of the first and last numbers on the list (400+400=800).
5. Now, if he wins, he crosses of both 400s from the list. If he loses, he adds 800 to the end of the list (400, 400, 400, 400, 400+800).
6. This continues until eventually there are no items left on the list. If there is only one number left, you bet it.


### Paroli Strategy
This system is opposite to Martingale.
Here you have to double winning bets. But if you continue to win and have
already won big, reduce the amount of your bet.
It makes this dice strategy relatively safer than the Martingale strategy,
because it aims at taking advantage of the lucky straight wins.
This strategy is beloved by users, who don’t want to risk big.

1. Fixed Base Stake
2. Doubling Up After Winning
3. Stop After Three Wins
4. Base Stake After Losing
