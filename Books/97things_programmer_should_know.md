- know the future of the language
  + which features for deprecation, to be added
- know what's wrong wz the lang
- know how you work around features that aren'n in the lang

###Write codes for humans not machines
- The rules can be applied to improve the code readability
 + keep each method as short as possible (15 lines)
 + give each method a single responsibility
 + declare methods with the lowest number of params possible (<= 3 params number)
 + avoid nested loop or condition where possible
 + write comments only when strictly necessary and keep them in sync with the code
 + establish a set of shared coding standard

###Speed skills
- the only way to go fast is to go well
- slow and steady wins the race
