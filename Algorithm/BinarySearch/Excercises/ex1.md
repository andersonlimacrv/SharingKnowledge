  1.1. Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search.
  What's the maximum number of steps it would take?

  1.2 Suppose you double the size of list. What's the maximum number of steps now?
```

```html
 1.1. the number of steps is: log(128)

 1.2.
  - double size of the list: 128 x 2 = 256
  - the number of steps is log(256)
